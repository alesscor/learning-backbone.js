# Learning Backbone.js

This is to learn Backbone.js and other technologies:

- Using http://cdnjs.com to get libraries from a Content Delivery Network.
- Using some Underscore.js functions.
- Using bootstrap-tour to provide a tour in the index page.
- Using bootstrap modals to warn about events going to be deleted instead of  alert in the interface.
- Using extensions and inheritance from Backbone Models, Views and * (i.e. Collections and Routers).
- Remember to reference the `this` instance you really mean. It's been done in some code with variable `self`.
- Added function to format date called `formatDate`, taken from http://stackoverflow.com/a/2315478/3802741.
- Added plugin Backbone.Validation, by extending Backbone.Validation.callbacks at /js/validation.js
- The validation interface is enhanced with data bindings, which are attached to data entry events to start giving feedback to the user.
